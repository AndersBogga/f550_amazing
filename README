1. Open the terminal and write ""printenv | grep GAZEBO"

2. Two or more paths should be displayed:
   GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=:/home/user/src/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models:/home/user/catkin_ws/src/simulation_control/src/models
   GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=:/home/user/src/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/Build

3. Gazebo gets it's models in this case from two paths which are told apart by the : sign.

4. Add the file gripper_plugin.cc in the folder one step up from your GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH which in this case would be "/home/user/src/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/src"

5. Type in TERMINAL:
	cd ~/home/user/src/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/Build  (GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH)
	cmake ../
	make

5. Add the folder "simulation_control" to your "catkin_ws/src" folder.

6. Type in TERMINAL: (building the catkin workspace)
	cd ~/catkin_ws
	catkin build

7. Type in terminal: (adding gazebo model path)
	sudo nano ~/.bashrc

8. Add the following line to the end of your GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:
	:/home/user/catkin_ws/src/simulation_control/src/models

   For example if it looks like this:
	export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=:/home/user/src/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models

   After editing it should look like this:
	export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=:/home/user/src/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models:/home/user/catkin_ws/src/simulation_control/src/models

7. Add the file f550_amazing to "/home/user/src/Firmware/posix-configs/SITL/init/lpe".
